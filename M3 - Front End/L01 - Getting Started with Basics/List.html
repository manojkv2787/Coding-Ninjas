            <h3>Commenting.</h3>
            <P>
            Commenting is one such practice that is 
            often ignored by programmers, especially 
            for codes that are written by multiple 
            programmers. But remember, commenting is 
            an important part of project you create. 
            With proper comments and organised files 
            its always easier for you or others to 
            jump in and understand where things are at
            and how they work.
